## C9 Workspace
<!--(http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/getting_started)-->

### Begin by setting up a new Workspace in C9 IDE: 
* Login to C9
* Create a new workspace 
* Name your *Workspace* for the app we will create ("your_new_workspace_name")
* Add a description.
* Select the "Ruby" icon to indicate we are using a Ruby IDE. (Note the others! Nifty, eh? ) 
* Click the create workspace button 
* Creating a workspace automagically generates a "Rails New" instance, and names it "your_new_workspace_name" anyway, so no need for that command!

### Environment and Framework Petting Zoo
 
* open a terminal (if not already open)
 Activity: [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)
* type "ls" to list the contents
* compare to the files you see on the left
* run the project by clicking the "run" button (which is like running "rails s" in a traditional local development environment) 
* click on the url in the terminal window and see your page holder for your app!
