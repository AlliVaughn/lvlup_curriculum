# Fundamentals:
##  Language 
## Activity: Patterns for Mapping
First, Take a look at these: 
* [This one](http://www.worldjournal.com/)
* [And This one](http://www.bbc.com/russian)
* [Let's not forget This one](http://www.aljazeera.net)
* [This one too!](http://www.20minutes.fr/)
 <!-- Intro discussion about the links. How many are there?  How are they the same?  Different? Can we map this to anything we need to do?  -->
* [Now let's look at this link. Notice anything?](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/news/graphics/prog_lang_poster.pdf)
 So, how can we overcome? Discuss. 
 <!-- time?, exposure? etc, but for now, do what WE can do, right?-->

##  Pseudocode
### Activity: Write steps to make a pb & j sandwich. 
* Watch this [Video of CS50 Pseudocode(17:08-25:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUB-aJXquUA)
* [Pseudo code Intro: CS 50: Harvard OCW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuFWYOnHwGM)
* [PB & J pseudo code Handout](http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf)
* Discuss. 

## A Whole New World (of Programming)
## Activities: Programming basics and Console
