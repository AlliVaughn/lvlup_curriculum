# Fundamentals:
##  Language 
## Activity: Patterns for Mapping
First, Take a look at these: 
* [This one](http://www.worldjournal.com/)
* [And This one](http://www.bbc.com/russian)
* [Let's not forget This one](http://www.aljazeera.net)
* [This one too!](http://www.20minutes.fr/)
How are they the same?  Different? Can we map this to anything we need to do?
* [Now let's look at this link. Notice anything?](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/news/graphics/prog_lang_poster.pdf)
 There are A LOT, aren't there?  
 For the  most part, They follow some pretty similar patterns.  
 The first thing to remember is that programming is a "literal" experience. 
 

##  Pseudocode
### Activity: Write steps to make a pb & j sandwich. 
* Now, Let's follow your  directions. 
* Watch this [CS50 Pseudocode(17:08-25:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUB-aJXquUA)
Guess where this class is taking place?  Yep!  
* [Pseudo code Intro: CS 50: Harvard OCW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuFWYOnHwGM)
* [PB & J pseudo code Handout](http://static.zerorobotics.mit.edu/docs/team-activities/ProgrammingPeanutButterAndJelly.pdf)
* Discuss. 

## A Whole New World (of Programming)
## Activities: Programming basics and Console
* [Practicing in IRB console: simple calculations, variables, arrays, loops and conditionals](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/ruby_language)
* [Even More Ruby Fun with Codecademy!](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-d1Ylq/0/1?curriculum_id=5059f8619189a5000201fbcb)
